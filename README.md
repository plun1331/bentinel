# Have you heard of Swofty Hosting?
While I'm currently dying of Twitter, my last words to you is today's sponsor, Swofty hosting! 

Swofty hosting is Minecraft Server hosting for the modern generation. They have over 2 terabytes of ram to host your server fast and efficiently. 

With a convient menu to use and useful features such as automatic mod and plugin installation, Swofty Hosting is usable by everyone! 

To get started, go to the [Atlas Development Discord](https://discord.gg/En2CMEuvR5) and look in #announcements to get started on making an account! And thank you to Swofty for giving me his money.
